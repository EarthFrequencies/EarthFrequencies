<h3>Welcome to Earth Frequencies</h3>

<p>Earth Frequencies is an attempt to create an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">open
   data</a> project around ‘radio frequency allocation’  tables, such that the data provided can be
   used by software applications, rather than simply being tied to word processor style documents.</p>


<h3>Example Uses</h3>

<p>One example scenario is that of an SDR application, where you can tune into any frequency. Within
   the application you would have a view which displays various supplementary information, that can 
   not be derived fromt the emission itself, amongst which would be the frequency allocations, as 
   defined by the ITU and member entities.</p>  

<h3>Contribution</h3>

<p>Being an open data project, any contribution or collaboration is appreciated. While we
   can't ensure that data is 100% perfect, by pooling efforts we can help ensure that the
   data quality of a higher quality and as up to date as possible.<p>
   
<p>Additionally, if you make use of the data, please let us know. This helps let us know
   that the project is being found useful and it also helps us know who involve if we
   make changes to the project that could impact others.<p>

<h3>License & Limitations</h3>

<p>The data in this project should be treated as being in the public domain.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that the data may contain inaccuracies, so you should do your own auditing,
   to ensure the data is correct according to official sources. The contributors can not be held
   responsible for any incorrect information within the project. Please consult official data sources
   for the most current information.</p>
