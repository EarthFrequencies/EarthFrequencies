Earth Fequencies

This is a collection of machine parasable data files, intended for use in an
amateur context, that describe radio frequency allocations and channels.

Currently this is an experiment into how best the data can be represented
for use in applications. For example, for SDR applications that can select
an appropriate data representation, loading the appropiate module, based
on what it 'knows' should be in the frequency it is scanning.

This should NOT be considered a primary source for this information. You
should always check official sources for accurate data about allocation and
usage requirements.
