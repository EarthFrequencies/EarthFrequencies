Earth Frequencies is an attempt to create an open data project around 'radio frequency
allocation' tables, such that the data provided can be used by software applications,
rather than simply being tied to word processor style documents.

An example scenario, where this data may be useful, is when using a desktop based SDR type
application, which provides an information window, which indicates what type of radio
data is present in the given range.
